Pointcloud Motion Capture is a ROS 2 package designed to process point clouds for capturing object movements. It detects objects using color filters and infers data about their position, velocity, and acceleration. 
This package has been tested under [ROS] Humble and Ubuntu 22.04

## Validation

### Experiment 1

- **Description:** The robot moves at a velocity of 0.05 m/s, while the system estimates 0.04 m/s. The distance traveled was 0.8m, and the system measured 0.82m.

## Installation

Clone the repository into your ROS 2 workspace and build the package:

```bash
cd <your_ros2_workspace>/src
git clone https://github.com/vitorsmends/pointcloud_motion_capture.git
```

### Install libraries
To successfully compile and run this ROS 2 package, ensure that you have the following libraries installed on your system:

- **PCL (Point Cloud Library)**: PCL is a powerful open-source library for 3D point cloud processing. You can download and install PCL from the [official PCL website](https://pointclouds.org/downloads/).

### Install dependencies and Building
```bash
cd <your_ros2_workspace>
rosdep install --from-paths src -y --ignore-src
colcon build
```

## Usage

### Launching the Package

To launch the motion capture system, run the following command:

```bash
ros2 launch pointcloud_motion_capture motion_capture.launch.py
```

### Configuration

The package comes with a configuration file for color filters. You can adjust the color filters by modifying the `colors.yaml` file located in the `config` directory.

### Nodes

The package consists of the following nodes:

- `motion_capture.cpp`: Node responsible for capturing object motion.
- `point_cloud_reader.cpp`: Node for reading point cloud data.

These nodes subscribe to the `/camera/camera/depth/color/points` topic of type `sensor_msgs/msg/PointCloud2` by default. The package has been tested using an Intel RealSense D435i depth camera.
